Write a java method to apply a greedy algorithm to calculate coin change. 
The function should be called greedyChange, and will take an amount (a non-negative int) 
and an array of unique denominations d1,...dn (positive ints) as parameters.

It should then return a Map from int to int showing how much of each denomination to use to get the amount. 
The denominations will be such that the greedy algorithm will be guaranteed to give an optimal solution. 
Note, if a denomination is not required in the solution, it should be included with, and map to 0.

java.util.* is automatically imported so all classes in java.util are available for you to use.

Example:

int[] denominations = {1,2,3};
Map<Integer,Integer> change = greedyChange(5, denominations);
Integer[] keys = change.keySet().toArray(new Integer[0]);
Arrays.sort(keys);
for(Integer i: keys)
  System.out.println(i+":"+change.get(i));

Result:
1:0
2:1
3:1
